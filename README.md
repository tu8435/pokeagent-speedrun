## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Pokémon Emerald ROM (not included - obtain legally)
- One of the supported VLM backends (see VLM Setup section)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sethkarten/pokeagent-speedrun
cd pokeagent-speedrun
```

### 2. Create Conda Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Create and activate the environment
conda create -n pokeagent python=3.10 -y
conda activate pokeagent
```

### 3. Install mgba System Library (Required for Python bindings)

Download and install the official Ubuntu package from the [mGBA downloads page](https://mgba.io/downloads.html):

Example for 20.04:
```bash
wget https://github.com/mgba-emu/mgba/releases/download/0.10.5/mGBA-0.10.5-ubuntu64-focal.tar.xz
tar -xf mGBA-0.10.5-ubuntu64-focal.tar.xz
sudo dpkg -i mGBA-0.10.5-ubuntu64-focal/libmgba.deb
```

### 4. Install Compatible libffi in Conda (Important!)

Before installing Python dependencies, ensure you have a compatible libffi version (3.3 or 7.x) in your conda environment:

```bash
conda install -n pokeagent libffi=3.3 -y
```

### 5. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 6. Set up Game ROM

**Important**: You must obtain a Pokémon Emerald ROM file legally (e.g., dump from your own cartridge).

1. Place your `PokemonEmerald.gba` ROM file in the `Emerald-GBAdvance/` directory:
   ```
   emerald/
   └── Emerald-GBAdvance/
       └── PokemonEmerald.gba  # Your ROM file here
   ```

2. The ROM file can be named anything with a `.gba` extension, but make sure it's a valid Pokémon Emerald ROM by checking the hash with `f3ae088181bf583e55daf962a92bb46f4f1d07b7`.

## VLM Backend Setup

The agent supports multiple VLM backends. Choose one based on your needs:

### 🔸 OpenAI (GPT-4V, o3-mini, etc.)

**Best for: Quick setup, reliable performance**

1. Set environment variable:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

2. Run agent:
```bash
python agent.py --backend openai --model-name "gpt-4o"
```

Supported models: `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `o3-mini`, etc.

### 🔸 OpenRouter (Access to many models)

**Best for: Trying different models, cost optimization**

1. Set environment variable:
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

2. Run agent:
```bash
python agent.py --backend openrouter --model-name "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet"
```

Supported models: `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet`, `google/gemini-pro-vision`, `openai/gpt-4o`, etc.

### 🔸 Google Gemini

**Best for: Google ecosystem integration**

1. Set environment variable:
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
# OR
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

2. Run agent:
```bash
python agent.py --backend gemini --model-name "gemini-1.5-pro"
```

### 🔸 Auto Backend Detection

**Best for: Easy switching between models**

```bash
# Automatically detects backend based on model name
python agent.py --backend auto --model-name "gpt-4o"          # → OpenAI
python agent.py --backend auto --model-name "gemini-1.5-pro"  # → Gemini
python agent.py --backend auto --model-name "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct"  # → Local
```

## Running the Agent

### 1. Start the Emulator Server

```bash
python -m server.app
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8000`. Open this URL in your browser to view the game interface.

### 2. Run the AI Agent

Choose your VLM backend and run:

```bash
# OpenAI example
python agent.py --backend openai --model-name "gpt-4o"

# Local model example  
python agent.py --backend local --model-name "Qwen/Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct"

# With additional options
python agent.py \
    --backend openai \
    --model-name "gpt-4o" \
    --debug-state  # Enable detailed state logging
```

  --debug-state           Enable detailed state debugging
```

## Customizing Agent Behavior (Prompt Editing Guide)

This starter kit is designed to be easily customizable. Here's how to edit the agent's behavior:

### 🎯 Main System Prompt

**File: `agent/system_prompt.py`**

This is the core personality of your agent. Edit this to change the overall behavior:

```python
# Current system prompt
system_prompt = """
You are an AI agent playing Pokémon Emerald on a Game Boy Advance emulator...
"""

# Example: Speedrunner personality
system_prompt = """
You are an expert Pokémon Emerald speedrunner. Your goal is to beat the game as quickly as possible using optimal strategies, routing, and tricks. Always think about efficiency and time-saving strategies.
"""

# Example: Casual player personality  
system_prompt = """
You are a casual Pokémon player exploring Emerald for fun. You enjoy catching different Pokémon, talking to NPCs, and thoroughly exploring each area. Take your time and enjoy the experience.
"""
```

### 🔍 Perception Module Prompts

**File: `agent/perception.py`**

Control how the agent observes and interprets the game state:

```python
# Find and edit the perception_prompt around line 24
perception_prompt = f"""
★★★ VISUAL ANALYSIS TASK ★★★

You are the agent, actively playing Pokemon Emerald...
"""

# Example customization for battle focus:
perception_prompt = f"""
★★★ BATTLE-FOCUSED VISUAL ANALYSIS ★★★

You are a competitive Pokemon battler. Pay special attention to:
- Pokemon types and weaknesses
- Move effectiveness and damage calculations  
- Status conditions and stat changes
- Switching opportunities
...
"""
```

### 🧠 Planning Module Prompts

**File: `agent/planning.py`**

Modify strategic planning behavior:

```python
# Find the planning_prompt around line 55
planning_prompt = f"""
★★★ STRATEGIC PLANNING TASK ★★★

You are the agent playing Pokemon Emerald with a speedrunning mindset...
"""

# Example: Exploration-focused planning
planning_prompt = f"""
★★★ EXPLORATION PLANNING TASK ★★★

You are curious explorer who wants to discover everything in Pokemon Emerald:
1. DISCOVERY GOALS: What new areas, Pokemon, or secrets can you find?
2. COLLECTION OBJECTIVES: What Pokemon should you catch or items should you collect?
3. INTERACTION STRATEGY: Which NPCs should you talk to for lore and tips?
...
"""
```

### 🎮 Action Module Prompts

**File: `agent/action.py`**

Control decision-making and button inputs:

```python
# Find the action_prompt around line 69
action_prompt = f"""
★★★ ACTION DECISION TASK ★★★

You are the agent playing Pokemon Emerald with a speedrunning mindset...
"""

# Example: Cautious player style
action_prompt = f"""
★★★ CAREFUL ACTION DECISIONS ★★★

You are a careful player who wants to avoid risks:
- Always heal Pokemon before they reach critical HP
- Avoid wild Pokemon encounters when possible
- Stock up on items before challenging gyms
- Save frequently at Pokemon Centers
...
"""
```

### 🧵 Memory Module Behavior

**File: `agent/memory.py`**

Customize what the agent remembers and prioritizes:

```python
# Edit the memory_step function around line 70
# Add custom key events tracking:

# Example: Track more specific events
if 'new_pokemon_caught' in state:
    key_events.append(f"Caught new Pokemon: {state['new_pokemon_caught']}")

if 'item_found' in state:
    key_events.append(f"Found item: {state['item_found']}")
```

### 🎨 Example: Creating a "Nuzlocke Challenge" Agent

Create a specialized agent for Nuzlocke rules:

1. **Edit `agent/system_prompt.py`**:
```python
system_prompt = """
You are playing Pokemon Emerald under strict Nuzlocke rules:
1. You may only catch the first Pokemon in each area
2. If a Pokemon faints, it's considered "dead" and must be released
3. You must nickname all caught Pokemon  
4. Play very cautiously to avoid losing Pokemon
"""
```

2. **Edit action prompts** to be more cautious about battles
3. **Edit memory** to track "living" vs "dead" Pokemon
4. **Edit perception** to emphasize Pokemon health monitoring

### 🔧 Testing Your Changes

1. Make your prompt edits
2. Restart the agent: `python agent.py --backend your-backend --model-name your-model`
3. Monitor the logs to see how behavior changes
4. Use `--debug-state` flag for detailed insights

### 💡 Prompt Engineering Tips

- **Be specific**: Instead of "play well", say "prioritize type advantages and stat buffs"
- **Use examples**: Show the agent exactly what you want with concrete examples
- **Test iteratively**: Make small changes and observe the effects
- **Use sections**: Break complex prompts into clear sections with headers
- **Consider context**: Remember the agent sees game state, not just the screen

## Advanced Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# VLM API Keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-key"  
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-key"

# Optional: Custom logging
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)"
```

### Local Model Optimization

For better performance with local models:

```bash
# Use specific GPU
python agent.py --backend local --device cuda:0 --model-name "your-model"

# Disable quantization for speed (requires more VRAM)
python agent.py --backend local --model-name "your-model" --device cuda

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Module not found" errors**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$(pwd)"
   ```

2. **Out of memory with local models**:
   ```bash
   # Try 4-bit quantization
   python agent.py --backend local --load-in-4bit --model-name "your-model"
   ```

3. **Server connection failed**:
   - Ensure `python -m server.app` is running
   - Check that port 8000 is available

4. **API rate limits**:
   - Use OpenRouter for better rate limits
   - Switch to local models for unlimited usage

### Performance Tips

- **OpenAI**: Fastest for quick prototyping
- **Local models**: Best for extended runs, no API costs
- **Debug mode**: Use `--debug-state` only when needed (verbose output)
